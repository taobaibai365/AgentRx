STEP_INDEX_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """

GIVEN INPUT:
- a full trajectory of an agent's interaction with a user (step-indexed)
- the ground-truth tool-call/action sequence the agent should have made
- (optional) Further, sometimes you may also be provided with a set of responses that the agent should have made in its response to the user at some step in the trajectory. Along with them, we will supply a boolean value indicating whether the agent's response included that output or not.

YOUR TASK is to determine ONLY the root-cause failure step index using the algorithm below.

ROOT-CAUSE DETECTION ALGORITHM:

Step 1 — Locate the first failure: Scan the trajectory step-by-step from the start and record the first failure.
Step 2 — Check if that failure was resolved: Look ahead in the trajectory for evidence that the error was resolved. If yes → Resolved; if no such evidence → Not resolved.
Step 3 — Decide and continue:
If Resolved: continue scanning from the next step to find the next new failure, then repeat Step 2 for it.
If Not resolved: treat this step as the root-cause failure for the run and output ONLY that step index.

Output a JSON object in the following format:
{{
    "reason_for_index": <string>,
    "index": <int>
}}

GIVEN INPUT:
- a full trajectory of an agent's interaction with a user (step-indexed)
- the ground-truth tool-call/action sequence the agent should have made
- optional: expected responses/outputs for some steps

YOUR TASK is to determine why the agent failed, which failure category applies from the taxonomy below, and exactly which step index the failure occurred at.

You are also provided a list of violations that have been generated through the trajectory through various invariants. Use these to help you identify the root cause category, failure step and agent.
Static invariants have been generated through the domain policy and system prompt. Each static invariant is associated with a tool call to ensure it adheres to the domain policy.
Dynamic invariants have been generated to cover computation checks, data accuracy, argument validity, and tool output consistency.
Each invariant returns a boolean, and if it returns false, it indicates a violation. Note that some violations may be false positives and not all violations may be relevant to the root cause failure.

Here are the list of violations noted by static and dynamic invariants:

{invariants_violation_context}

FAILURE TAXONOMY CATEGORIES:
{taxonomy_block}

ROOT-CAUSE DETECTION ALGORITHM:

Step 1 — Locate the first failure: Scan the trajectory step-by-step from the start and record the first failure.
Step 2 — Check if that failure was resolved: Look ahead in the trajectory for evidence that the error was resolved. If yes → Resolved; if no such evidence → Not resolved.
Step 3 — Decide and continue:
If Resolved: continue scanning from the next step to find the next new failure, then repeat Step 2 for it.
If Not resolved: treat this step as the root-cause failure for the run and assign the taxonomy at this step.

Output a JSON object in the following format:
{{
    "reason_for_failure": <string>,
    "failure_case": <int 1-10>,
    "reason_for_index": <string>,

- Always include "instruction" in the IR dict (use empty string if missing).
