EXAMPLES_BLOCK_TAU_RETAIL = r"""
================================================================================================
EXAMPLES OF INVARIANTS YOU MUST INCLUDE
================================================================================================
You MUST include invariant templates that cover each of these retail domain requirements:

(1) User authentication must happen first (TEMPORAL)
- Before any order operations or product listing, user must be authenticated via find_user_id_by_email or find_user_id_by_name_zip
- This applies to: list_all_product_types, get_order_details, get_user_details, get_product_details, cancel_pending_order, exchange_delivered_order_items, return_delivered_order_items, modify_pending_order_*, modify_user_address
- Even if user provides user_id, authentication via email/name+zip is required
- IMPORTANT: Use source_regex to match all these tools: "list_all_product_types|get_order_details|get_user_details|get_product_details|cancel_pending_order|exchange_delivered_order_items|return_delivered_order_items|modify_pending_order_.*|modify_user_address"

(2) Order status validation before actions (PROTOCOL/CAPABILITY)
- cancel_pending_order can only be called if order status is 'pending'
- exchange_delivered_order_items can only be called if order status is 'delivered'
- return_delivered_order_items can only be called if order status is 'delivered'
- modify_pending_order_* tools can only be called if order status is 'pending'
- IMPORTANT: For each of these, set source_regex to the specific tool name (e.g., "cancel_pending_order")
- This ensures the check only triggers when that specific tool is called

(3) Cancellation reason validation (SCHEMA)
- cancel_pending_order reason must be either 'no longer needed' or 'ordered by mistake'

(4) Single-use modification tools (PROTOCOL)
- exchange_delivered_order_items can only be called once per order_id
- modify_pending_order_items can only be called once per order_id

(5) User confirmation for consequential actions (TEMPORAL)
- Before calling any database-write tools (cancel, modify, return, exchange),
  there must be evidence of explicit user confirmation (e.g., "yes")
- This is a semantic check requiring nl_check
- IMPORTANT: Use source_regex to match write-action tools: "cancel_pending_order|exchange_delivered_order_items|return_delivered_order_items|modify_pending_order_.*|modify_user_address"
- Rubric should have self-contained criteria like:
  * "A user message contains explicit affirmation keywords (yes/confirm/proceed/ok)"
  * "An assistant content message describes the specific action type (cancel/modify/exchange/return/address update) and includes the relevant identifier (order_id or user_id)"
  * "The identifier (order_id or user_id) mentioned in the assistant's description matches the identifier in the current tool call arguments"
- Focus_steps should specify WHERE to look:
  * "The user message 1 step back for confirmation keywords"
  * "The assistant message 2 steps back for action description and identifier"
  * "The current tool call arguments for the identifier to verify consistency"

(6) One user per conversation (PROTOCOL)
- Only one user_id should be authenticated per conversation
- Agent must deny requests related to other users

(7) No information invention or misinterpretation (PROVENANCE)
- Agent should not make up information not provided by user or tools
- Agent should not misinterpret or incorrectly process information from tool outputs
- Response content must be grounded in tool outputs AND correctly interpreted
- This is a semantic check requiring nl_check
- IMPORTANT: Trigger only on assistant events with content (no tool_calls)
- Use source_regex "*" for assistant messages, but check content is not null
- Rubric should have self-contained criteria covering BOTH invention AND misinterpretation:

  INVENTION checks (making up data):
  * "If assistant mentions a specific order_id, that order_id appears in a prior get_order_details result"
  * "If assistant states a status value, that status appears in a prior tool result"
  * "If assistant mentions a product_id or item_id, that ID appears in a prior tool result"
  * "If assistant mentions a currency amount, it either: (a) appears exactly in a prior tool result, OR (b) is clearly described as a calculated value (e.g., 'refund of $X', 'difference of $Y', 'total will be $Z') based on amounts that DO appear in prior tool results AND the calculation is mathematically correct"
  * "If assistant mentions a date/timeline, it either appears in prior tool results or is a general policy statement"

  MISINTERPRETATION checks (wrong processing of existing data):
  * "If assistant mentions counts or quantities (e.g., 'you have 3 items', 'there are 2 orders'), verify the count matches the actual number in the tool result by counting array elements or list items"
  * "If assistant summarizes order items or products, verify all mentioned items actually exist in the order and no items are omitted or added"
  * "If assistant states aggregated information (e.g., 'total price', 'combined shipping'), verify the aggregation is computed correctly from the source data"
  * "If assistant describes item options or specifications (e.g., 'color: red', 'size: large'), verify those exact option values appear in the tool result for that item"
  * "If assistant mentions shipping/tracking information, verify it matches the tracking_id and related fields in the fulfillments array"

  IMPORTANT:
  - Break into specific fact types - avoid criteria like "all facts are grounded"
  - Calculated amounts (refunds, differences, totals) are acceptable if base amounts exist and arithmetic is correct
  - Counts and aggregations must be verified against actual data in tool results
  - Item details must match exactly - no approximations or incorrect mappings

(8) Tool call atomicity (PROTOCOL)
- Agent should make at most one tool call at a time
- If making tool call, should not respond to user simultaneously

================================================================================================
EXAMPLES OF INVARIANTS YOU MUST INCLUDE (FLASH / INCIDENT MANAGEMENT DOMAIN)
================================================================================================
You MUST include invariant templates that cover each of these FLASH incident-domain requirements.
These invariants should be plan-relative (derived from the plan text in the trajectory), NOT HARD-CODED TO ONE SPECIFIC PLAN OR KUSTO QUERY.
DO NOT HARD-CODE ANY PLAN-SPECIFIC DETAILS; RATHER, WRITE GENERAL INVARIANTS THAT CAN APPLY TO ANY PLAN/QUERY IN THE FLASH INCIDENT DOMAIN.

(1) Plan step sequence must be followed (TEMPORAL)
- Orchestrator ledger transitions must follow the plan: Step-1 -> Step-2 -> ... -> FINAL_ANSWER -> DONE
- Allow only transitions explicitly listed in "next steps" in the plan text.
- Trigger: role_name=Orchestrator

(2) Field extraction integrity: extracted IDs must match incident description (SCHEMA/PROTOCOL)
- Any extracted identifiers (team name, nodeID, container IDs) must come from the user's incident description.
- No hallucinated IDs introduced later.

(3) Kusto query MUST match the plan template (SCHEMA/PROTOCOL)
- When the plan provides an explicit query block template, the KustoAgent query MUST be structurally derived from it.
- Fail if the query is missing a required anchor from the plan (e.g., missing cluster()/database()).

(4) Multi-ID query must preserve per-ID attribution (PROTOCOL, PRE_TOOL)
- If Orchestrator asks to run the plan query "for each container ID" but KustoAgent uses "in (...)" to batch,
  then the query MUST preserve attribution by including ContainerId in the output.
- Rationale: otherwise results cannot be mapped back to each requested ID.

(5) Portal link correctness when ArmId exists (SCHEMA, POST_TOOL)
- If an ArmId exists, the generated portal link MUST be:
  "https://ms.portal.azure.com/#@microsoft.onmicrosoft.com/resource" + <ArmId>
- If ArmId is null, the ONLY allowed link is "https://ms.portal.azure.com/#home".
- Fail if the link prefix is wrong, the ArmId is malformed, or #home is used when ArmId is present.

(6) Orchestrator must not end with "No agent selected" when blocked (PROTOCOL)
- If the workflow is blocked and requires user input, Orchestrator MUST select the user as next speaker and
  emit a clear instruction_or_question (with concrete fields requested).
- Fail if the run terminates due to orchestration error instead of handing off to the user.

(7) FINAL_ANSWER must exist and be last (TEMPORAL)
- If the plan includes a FINAL_ANSWER step, then:
  * Orchestrator must eventually set next_step to FINAL_ANSWER,
  * a final assistant message must be emitted after that transition,
  * and there must be a termination to DONE (not "No agent selected").
- Trigger: role_name=Orchestrator, content_regex="FINAL_ANSWER|termination condition|next_step"
- Fail if run ends without reaching FINAL_ANSWER when the plan expects it,
  OR reaches FINAL_ANSWER but does not emit a final answer message.

(8) Tool-call atomicity (PROTOCOL)
- At most one tool delegation per LLM event/step (e.g., Orchestrator should not call IncidentAgent and KustoAgent in the same step).
- Trigger: any step containing "Orchestrator (-> X)"
- Fail if more than one distinct tool delegation appears in the same step/event.

      2. Add an IR converter function in ir/trajectory_ir.py.
      3. Register both in DOMAIN_REGISTRY.
