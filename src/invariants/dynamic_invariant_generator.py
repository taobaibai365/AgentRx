Domain-agnostic DYNAMIC invariant generator.

Supports two modes:
  --mode stepbystep   Generate one invariant per trajectory step (default)
  --mode oneshot      Generate all invariants in a single LLM call per trajectory

Supports domains: flash, tau, magentic (via --domain flag)
Supports both static and dynamic invariants (via --include-nl-check / --no-nl-check)

Usage (from src/ directory — required for imports):
  cd src

  # Tau-retail: step-by-step on a single trajectory
  python -m invariants.dynamic_invariant_generator --domain tau \
      --mode stepbystep --input-path ../../trajectories/tau-retail/hallucination_doubt.json

  # Tau-retail: one-shot, python-only checks
  python -m invariants.dynamic_invariant_generator --domain tau \
      --mode oneshot --input-path ../../trajectories/tau-retail/misinterpretation_tool_output.json --no-nl-check

  # Tau-retail: step-by-step on all files in directory
  python -m invariants.dynamic_invariant_generator --domain tau \
      --mode stepbystep --input-path ../../trajectories/tau-retail/

  # Magentic-One: step-by-step on all trajectory files
  python -m invariants.dynamic_invariant_generator --domain magentic \
      --mode stepbystep --input-path ../../trajectories/magentic-one/trajectories/

  # Magentic-One: single trajectory with Azure endpoint and custom output dir
  python -m invariants.dynamic_invariant_generator --domain magentic \

  # Flash: step-by-step on magentic dataset directory
  python -m invariants.dynamic_invariant_generator --domain flash \
      --input-path ../../data/magentic_dataset/

  NOTE: --input-path is resolved relative to src/invariants/ (where this script lives).

DYNAMIC_INVARIANT_PROMPT_WITHOUT_NL_CHECK = """
You are an expert at analyzing agent trajectories and generating step-specific dynamic invariants which are programmable for trajectory verification. 
Your task is to analyze the current step in an agent's execution trajectory and determine if any invariant should be generated for verification for this specific step.

REUSE the previous assertions wherever possible, do NOT create new ones unless absolutely necessary. Prioritize computation checks wherever computation is required such as counting, summing, comparison, etc.

You will be provided with the overall task instruction, the static invariants already generated, and the full agent trajectory up to the current step.

**IMPORTANT**: Static invariants have already been generated to cover general policy violations, preconditions, sequential dependencies, and business rules. Focus ONLY on cases NOT covered by static invariants, such as:
- Computation errors (counting, summing, calculations)
- Step-specific validation that static invariants cannot capture

## Context Information:
**Task Instruction:** <<TASK_INSTRUCTION>>

**Current Step Index:** <<STEP_NUM>>

## Your Task:
Analyze the current step in the trajectory and generate dynamic invariants that:
1. Are simple enough to implement via python or NL checks.
2. Can be checked at this specific step in the trajectory (e.g., computation checks from tool call results)
3. Focus on **critical errors or policy violations** NOT already covered by static invariants
4. Are objectively verifiable from trajectory data
5. Fill gaps left by static invariants, particularly computation and step-specific validation
6. Provide working Python code or Natural Language (NL) check for each dynamic assertion that can be executed

## Focus Areas:
Generate assertions for these key constraint types (ONLY if NOT covered by static invariants):

### **Computation Checks**
- Verify numerical calculations, aggregations, and data accuracy.
- Examples:
  - Financial: "Transaction total should equal sum of line items plus applicable fees"
  - Inventory: "Remaining stock after reservation should be original stock minus reserved quantity"
  - Healthcare: "Medication dosage calculations should be within safe therapeutic ranges"

### **Context-Specific Business Logic**
- Step-specific rules that depend on current trajectory state
- Examples:
  - Retail: "Discount calculations based on current cart contents and user loyalty level"
  - Financial: "Credit limit checks based on current account status and transaction history"
  - Healthcare: "Drug interaction checks based on current prescription list"
  - Workflow: "Approval requirements based on current user role and request amount"

### **Cross-Tool Data Validation**
- Verify data integrity across multiple tool interactions in the same session
- Examples:
  - "Entity identifiers referenced in later steps must match those retrieved in earlier tool outputs"
  - Retail: "Items added to cart must still be available when proceeding to checkout"
  - "If the agent claims an action succeeded, subsequent tool outputs must show evidence consistent with the claim"
  - Financial: "Exchange rates used in calculations must be consistent across related transactions"
  - Healthcare: "Lab results referenced in diagnosis must match the lab results retrieved"
  - System: "File permissions checked must match the permissions set in previous operations"

Output MUST be valid JSON only (no markdown, no commentary), with EXACT keys and structure defined below.

CRITICAL FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:
1. Output ONLY valid JSON - NO markdown code blocks (no ```json or ```)
2. Use double quotes for all strings (not single quotes)
3. Ensure all commas are placed correctly between array/object elements
4. Ensure all brackets and braces are properly closed
5. Follow the EXACT schema below - do not add or remove fields
6. Validate your JSON before outputting
7. TAXONOMY TARGETS: Use ONLY values from the allowed list.
8. ONLY PRODUCE PYTHON_CHECK INVARIANTS: check type should ALWAYS be python check that is, "check_type": "python_check", the nl_check fields should ALWAYS be empty.

================================================================================================
TRAJECTORY FORMAT (IMPORTANT) - THIS WILL BE GIVEN AS AN INPUT PARAMETER
================================================================================================

TRAJECTORY:
The runtime provides a trajectory dict in the following IR schema:

          "content": "str"  // The content of this substep
        }

## Quality Guidelines:
- **Policy-Derived**: Must be supported by the policy document content, include any user confirmation checks before critical actions if specified in policy
- **Practical Impact**: Focus on assertions that prevent real operational problems
- **Domain-Relevant**: Prioritize rules specific to this business domain
- **Reasonable Scope**: Avoid both trivial sanity checks and overly complex checks that would be difficult to implement reliably.

## Trigger Robustness Rules:
- content_regex MUST be robust to formatting differences (markdown, punctuation, extra whitespace, casing).
- NEVER hardcode markdown-sensitive exact strings like:
    "Tool result:\\s*Query successful"
  because real traces often contain:
    "**Tool result:**\\nQuery successful. ..."
- Prefer matching stable substrings that survive formatting changes.
- Prefer SHORT regexes. Avoid overfitting to ":" vs "**:**" vs "." variations.
- Avoid brittle patterns that depend on exact formatting or punctuation.
- Make sure to match the role name perfectly and overapproximate if you are unsure.

Each invariant should be as GENERAL as possible, if many specific invariants can be combined into one invariant function, do so.
For example, an invariant which checks order status validity for various tool calls can be combined into one function.

================================================================================================
## PYTHON CHECK GUIDELINES
================================================================================================

## Python Code Guidelines:
- Write complete, executable Python functions
- You will be given 2 parameters - (trajectory and current_step_index), where trajectory is the full IR dict with "steps" field
- Access steps via trajectory["steps"][current_step_index] - steps list is 0-indexed
- Each step has "index" (1-based) and "substeps" array
- Each substep has "sub_index", "role", and "content"
- The current_step_index is 0-based. So if the current step being executed has index=7, current_step_index will be 6.
- Include docstrings explaining the assertion
- Look at the tool response key fields very carefully while writing the code.
  1. First, identify which tool(s) you're working with in the current trajectory step
  2. Pay attention to nested dictionaries (use chained .get() calls) and list structures (check length before indexing)
  3. Note the data types (str, float, bool, list, dict) to avoid type errors
  4. Use ONLY the exact field names shown in the tool structure - do NOT invent or assume field names
- Handle edge cases and missing data gracefully - verify field existence and type before operations
- Focus on computation validation and step-specific checks, avoid very trivial sanity checks
- **Exception Handling**: Raise exceptions for safety check violations (KeyError, IndexError, TypeError, AttributeError, ValueError, etc.) instead of returning False. Let these exceptions propagate naturally. Only return boolean (True/False) for actual invariant logic violations
- Return boolean values (True if assertion passes, False if invariant violation detected)
- **Add print statements for debugging**: Start with printing the function name, then print all key variables, extracted JSON fields, and intermediate calculation results to aid in debugging and verification

================================================================================================
## PYTHON_CHECK ANTI-HALLUCINATION RULES
================================================================================================
- A python_check MUST implement ONLY the exact condition(s) described in this invariant's `check_hint`.
- FORBIDDEN: adding "extra" checks that are not explicitly part of check_hint.
  Examples of forbidden extras:
  * checking additional URLs/IDs/regexes beyond the targeted substring(s)
  * inferring "plan rules" not explicitly spelled out in check_hint
  * scanning many steps for unrelated markers "just in case"
  * inventing secondary conditions like "also must not contain X" unless required by check_hint
- Keep python_check SMALL and TARGETED:
  * prefer 1-3 simple extractions + 1 boolean condition
  * avoid long keyword lists and complex regex (if you need that, it is probably a nl_check candidate)

================================================================================================
DECISION GUIDE: PYTHON_CHECK VS NL_CHECK
================================================================================================
Use python_check when:
- Tool output is structured JSON with extractable fields (e.g., get_order_details, get_user_details)
- Check involves counting, summing, or comparing numeric values
- Check involves verifying exact field matches (IDs, status codes, amounts, dates)
- Check involves parsing and validating data structure or schema
- Check uses simple regex patterns (e.g., matching an order_id format like r"#W\\d+" or extracting keys or specific count in the content message)
- Check involves deterministic string containment or exact substring matching

Use nl_check when:
- Check requires understanding paraphrasing or semantic equivalence (e.g., "bigger size" = "larger size")
- Check requires judging whether two different phrasings express the same intent
- Check requires evaluating whether user agent messages align with task instruction semantically
- The content is unstructured natural language without clear fields to extract
- Check would require a long list of synonyms or variations to cover programmatically

A naive python_check approach would try to match exact phrases like:
  - "I want to return"
  - "I'd like to exchange"
  - "cancel my order"
  - "modify my address"
  - "get a refund"
  - "change the items"
But users express the same intent in many ways:
  - "Could you help me send back..." (return)
  - "I need to swap this for..." (exchange)
  - "Please void the order" (cancel)
  - "Update my shipping info" (modify address)
Matching exact phrases is brittle and incomplete. Use nl_check for semantic intent.

================================================================================================
## PYTHON CHECK GUIDELINES
================================================================================================

## Python Code Guidelines:
- Write complete, executable Python functions
- You will be given 2 parameters - (trajectory and current_step_index), where trajectory is the full IR dict with "steps" field
- Access steps via trajectory["steps"][current_step_index] - steps list is 0-indexed
- Each step has "index" (1-based) and "substeps" array
- Each substep has "sub_index", "role", and "content"
- The current_step_index is 0-based. So if the current step being executed has index=7, current_step_index will be 6.
- Include docstrings explaining the assertion
- Look at the tool response key fields very carefully while writing the code.
  1. First, identify which tool(s) you're working with in the current trajectory step
  2. Pay attention to nested dictionaries (use chained .get() calls) and list structures (check length before indexing)
  3. Note the data types (str, float, bool, list, dict) to avoid type errors
  4. Use ONLY the exact field names shown in the tool structure - do NOT invent or assume field names
- Handle edge cases and missing data gracefully - verify field existence and type before operations
- Focus on computation validation and step-specific checks, avoid very trivial sanity checks
- **Exception Handling**: Raise exceptions for safety check violations (KeyError, IndexError, TypeError, AttributeError, ValueError, etc.) instead of returning False. Let these exceptions propagate naturally. Only return boolean (True/False) for actual invariant logic violations
- Return boolean values (True if assertion passes, False if invariant violation detected)
- **Add print statements for debugging**: Start with printing the function name, then print all key variables, extracted JSON fields, and intermediate calculation results to aid in debugging and verification

================================================================================================
## PYTHON_CHECK ANTI-HALLUCINATION RULES
================================================================================================
- A python_check MUST implement ONLY the exact condition(s) described in this invariant's `check_hint`.
- FORBIDDEN: adding "extra" checks that are not explicitly part of check_hint.
  Examples of forbidden extras:
  * checking additional URLs/IDs/regexes beyond the targeted substring(s)
  * inferring "plan rules" not explicitly spelled out in check_hint
  * scanning many steps for unrelated markers "just in case"
  * inventing secondary conditions like "also must not contain X" unless required by check_hint
- Keep python_check SMALL and TARGETED:
  * prefer 1-3 simple extractions + 1 boolean condition
  * avoid long keyword lists and complex regex (if you need that, it is probably a nl_check candidate)

================================================================================================
## NL CHECK GUIDELINES
================================================================================================

For nl_check invariants, MUST include a "focus_steps_instruction" field that tells the judge which specific events to pay attention to.

The instruction should:
1. Be clear and actionable - the judge should know exactly which events to look at
2. Identify 2-4 critical events by their position relative to current_step_index
3. Explain WHY each event is important for the evaluation
4. Use relative positioning (e.g., "immediately prior", "2 steps back", "most recent X tool result")

EXAMPLES OF GOOD FOCUS STEPS INSTRUCTIONS:

For confirmation checks:
"Focus your evaluation on these key events: (1) The immediately prior message - check for explicit confirmation keywords like 'yes', 'confirm', 'proceed', 'ok'. (2) The assistant message two to three steps back - verify that it describes the action of interest (cancel/modify/exchange/return) and mentions the relevant target entity identifier(s) and critical parameters (e.g., record/entity ID, amount, destination, items, scope). (3) The current tool call arguments - verify they match the order_id/incident_id and details mentioned by another agent."

For information invention checks:
"Focus on: (1) The current agent content message being evaluated. (2) The most recent relevant tool results in the window — extract the authoritative facts actually present (identifiers, key fields/attributes, timestamps, computed outputs). (3) Compare specific claims in the agent's message against these tool results."

For temporal/prerequisite checks:
"Focus on: (1) The current tool call event — identify what operation is being attempted and what prerequisites it implies (authentication, entity lookup, permission check, required context fetch, state precondition). (2) Scan backward through all prior events to find the most recent event(s) that satisfy each prerequisite. (3) Most recent state snapshot for the same target entity — locate the latest tool result that reports the entity's current state."

KEY PRINCIPLES:
- Be specific about WHICH events (by relative position or role+name)
- Explain WHAT to look for in each event
- Make it easy for the judge to locate and examine the right evidence
- Reduce cognitive load by narrowing focus to what matters most

================================================================================================
COMPLETE NL_CHECK INVARIANT EXAMPLE
================================================================================================
Below is a complete example of an nl_check invariant. Use this as a template when the check requires semantic understanding, paraphrasing detection, intent alignment, or meaning-based evaluation that cannot be reliably done with keyword/regex matching.

WHY THIS MUST BE NL_CHECK (NOT PYTHON_CHECK):
A naive python_check approach would try to match exact phrases like:
  - "I want to return"
  - "I'd like to exchange"
  - "cancel my order"
  - "modify my address"
  - "get a refund"
  - "change the items"
But users express the same intent in many ways:
  - "Could you help me send back..." (return)
  - "I need to swap this for..." (exchange)
  - "Please void the order" (cancel)
  - "Update my shipping info" (modify address)

DYNAMIC_INVARIANT_PROMPT_ONESHOT_WITHOUT_NL_CHECK = """
You are an expert at analyzing agent trajectories and generating step-specific dynamic invariants for trajectory verification.
Your task is to analyze the current step in an agent's execution trajectory and determine if any invariant (Python or Natural Language) should be generated for verification for this specific step.

**IMPORTANT**: Static invariants have already been generated to cover general policy violations, preconditions, sequential dependencies, and business rules. Focus ONLY on cases NOT covered by static invariants, such as:

You will be provided with the overall task instruction, the static invariants already generated (SO YOU DON'T REPEAT THEM), and the FULL agent trajectory.

Generate ONLY high-signal invariants.

**CRITICAL**: For each invariant, choose the BEST check type:
- Use **python_check** for structured data validation, JSON parsing, numeric calculations, deterministic string matching, and field extraction.
- Use **nl_check** for semantic intent evaluation, paraphrasing equivalence, natural language understanding, and flexible user confirmation verification
- More information provided on DECISION GUIDE below. 

## Context Information:
**Task Instruction:** <<TASK_INSTRUCTION>>

## YOUR TASK (ONE-SHOT):
Analyze the FULL trajectory and output a SET of dynamic invariants. Each invariant MUST:
1) Be verifiable from the available trajectory data (deterministically for python_check; rubric-based for nl_check if enabled)
2) Not already covered by any static invariant
3) Be high-signal for catching likely failures (computation/aggregation, cross-tool consistency, provenance, temporal prerequisites)
4) Be step-specific via event_trigger so it triggers only where it matters

IMPORTANT:
- You are NOT limited to a single step. You may emit invariants for multiple steps in this ONE response.
- Return a JSON array of invariants with the schema specified below.

## Your Task:
Analyze the full trajectory and generate dynamic invariants that:
1. Are simple enough to implement via python or NL checks.
2. Can be checked at this specific step in the trajectory (e.g., computation checks from tool call results)
3. Focus on **critical errors or policy violations** NOT already covered by static invariants
4. Are objectively verifiable from trajectory data
5. Fill gaps left by static invariants, particularly computation and step-specific validation
6. Provide working Python code or Natural Language (NL) check for each dynamic assertion that can be executed

## FOCUS AREAS:
Generate invariants that would DETECT the following failure patterns at ANY step in the trajectory:

### **Computation Checks**
- Verify numerical calculations, aggregations, and data accuracy.
- Examples:
  - Financial: "Transaction total should equal sum of line items plus applicable fees"
  - Inventory: "Remaining stock after reservation should be original stock minus reserved quantity"
  - Healthcare: "Medication dosage calculations should be within safe therapeutic ranges"

### **Context-Specific Business Logic**
- Step-specific rules that depend on current trajectory state
- Examples:
  - Retail: "Discount calculations based on current cart contents and user loyalty level"
  - Financial: "Credit limit checks based on current account status and transaction history"
  - Healthcare: "Drug interaction checks based on current prescription list"
  - Workflow: "Approval requirements based on current user role and request amount"

### **Cross-Tool Data Validation**
- Verify data integrity across multiple tool interactions in the same session
- Examples:
  - "Entity identifiers referenced in later steps must match those retrieved in earlier tool outputs"
  - Retail: "Items added to cart must still be available when proceeding to checkout"
  - "If the agent claims an action succeeded, subsequent tool outputs must show evidence consistent with the claim"
  - Financial: "Exchange rates used in calculations must be consistent across related transactions"
  - Healthcare: "Lab results referenced in diagnosis must match the lab results retrieved"
  - System: "File permissions checked must match the permissions set in previous operations"

### **Sequential Dependencies** 
Required ordering between investigation steps and communication steps
- Examples:
  - Incident Management:: "IncidentAgent (fetch incident description) must precede KustoAgent (run diagnostics) for the same incident."
  - General: "User authentication must precede any data access operations"
  - Retail: "User must give explicit confirmation (yes) before any consequential database write actions"

### **Business Rule Constraints**
- Domain-specific operational limits and rules. Incident-management operational limits, safety/compliance constraints, and evidence-grounding rules
- Examples:
  - Incident Management: "Incident updates (or equivalent external communication steps) must be grounded in prior tool outputs (e.g., Kusto results, incident descriptions) within the same trajectory."
  - Incident Management: "IncidentAgent must only return incident descriptions (no extra troubleshooting); KustoAgent must only execute/provide query results (no invented interpretation)."
  - Retail: "Items can only be exchanged within same product category"
  - Healthcare: "Prescriptions require valid medical license verification"
  - Financial: "Transfer amounts cannot exceed daily limits"
  - Legal: "Document modifications require authorized personnel only"

### **Single-Use Restrictions**
- Actions that should occur at most once per incident (or once per approval) to avoid duplicate/unsafe operations
- Examples:
  - Incident Management: "Do not re-run the same Kusto query repeatedly without a stated reason (e.g., changed time window, different cluster, new hypothesis)."
  - Healthcare: "Critical procedure authorization can only be granted once"
  - Financial: "Account closure can only be initiated once per request"
  - System: "Database migration can only be executed once per maintenance window"
 
Output MUST be valid JSON only (no markdown, no commentary), with EXACT keys and structure defined below.

CRITICAL FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:
1. Output ONLY valid JSON - NO markdown code blocks (no ```json or ```)
2. Use double quotes for all strings (not single quotes)
3. Ensure all commas are placed correctly between array/object elements
4. Ensure all brackets and braces are properly closed
5. Follow the EXACT schema below - do not add or remove fields
6. Validate your JSON before outputting
7. TAXONOMY TARGETS: Use ONLY values from the allowed list.
8. ONLY PRODUCE PYTHON_CHECK INVARIANTS: check type should ALWAYS be python check that is, "check_type": "python_check", the nl_check fields should ALWAYS be empty.

================================================================================================
TRAJECTORY FORMAT (IMPORTANT) - THIS WILL BE GIVEN AS AN INPUT PARAMETER
================================================================================================

TRAJECTORY:
The runtime provides a trajectory dict in the following IR schema:

{
  "trajectory_id": "str",
  "instruction": "str",  // The overall task instruction
  "steps": [
    {
      "index": int,  // 1-based step index
      "substeps": [
        {
          "sub_index": int,  // 1-based substep index within the step
          "role": "str",  // The role of the substep
          "content": "str"  // The content of this substep
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

IMPORTANT ACCESS PATTERNS:
- To get instruction: trajectory["instruction"]
- To access step N: trajectory["steps"][N-1] (steps list is 0-indexed, but step.index is 1-based)
- To get substeps of a step: step.get("substeps", [])
- To get content: substep.get("content")
- To get role: substep.get("role")

## Quality Guidelines:
- **Policy-Derived**: Must be supported by the policy document content, include any user confirmation checks before critical actions if specified in policy
- **Practical Impact**: Focus on assertions that prevent real operational problems
- **Domain-Relevant**: Prioritize rules specific to this business domain
- **Reasonable Scope**: Avoid both trivial sanity checks and computation checks better suited for dynamic invariants.

## Trigger Robustness Rules:
- content_regex MUST be robust to formatting differences (markdown, punctuation, extra whitespace, casing).
- NEVER hardcode markdown-sensitive exact strings like:
    "Kusto result:\s*Query successful"
  because real traces often contain:
    "**Kusto result:**\nQuery successful. ..."
- Prefer matching stable substrings that survive formatting changes.
- Prefer SHORT regexes. Avoid overfitting to ":" vs "**:**" vs "." variations.
- Avoid brittle patterns that depend on exact formatting or punctuation.
- Make sure to match the role name perfectly and overapproximate if you are unsure.

Each invariant should be as GENERAL as possible, if many specific invariants can be combined into one invariant function, do so.
For example, an invariant which checks order status validity for various tool calls can be combined into one function.

================================================================================================

<<TRAJECTORY>>"""

DYNAMIC_INVARIANT_PROMPT_ONESHOT = """
You are an expert at analyzing agent trajectories and generating step-specific dynamic invariants for trajectory verification.
Your task is to analyze the current step in an agent's execution trajectory and determine if any invariant (Python or Natural Language) should be generated for verification for this specific step.

**IMPORTANT**: Static invariants have already been generated to cover general policy violations, preconditions, sequential dependencies, and business rules. Focus ONLY on cases NOT covered by static invariants, such as:

You will be provided with the overall task instruction, the static invariants already generated (SO YOU DON'T REPEAT THEM), and the FULL agent trajectory.

Generate ONLY high-signal invariants.

**CRITICAL**: For each invariant, choose the BEST check type:
- Use **python_check** for structured data validation, JSON parsing, numeric calculations, deterministic string matching, and field extraction.
- Use **nl_check** for semantic intent evaluation, paraphrasing equivalence, natural language understanding, and flexible user confirmation verification
- More information provided on DECISION GUIDE below. 

## Context Information:
**Task Instruction:** <<TASK_INSTRUCTION>>

## YOUR TASK (ONE-SHOT):
Analyze the FULL trajectory and output a SET of dynamic invariants. Each invariant MUST:
1) Be verifiable from the available trajectory data (deterministically for python_check; rubric-based for nl_check if enabled)
2) Not already covered by any static invariant
3) Be high-signal for catching likely failures (computation/aggregation, cross-tool consistency, provenance, temporal prerequisites)
4) Be step-specific via event_trigger so it triggers only where it matters

IMPORTANT:
- You are NOT limited to a single step. You may emit invariants for multiple steps in this ONE response.
- Return a JSON array of invariants with the schema specified below.

## Your Task:
Analyze the full trajectory and generate dynamic invariants that:
1. Are simple enough to implement via python or NL checks.
2. Can be checked at this specific step in the trajectory (e.g., computation checks from tool call results)
3. Focus on **critical errors or policy violations** NOT already covered by static invariants
4. Are objectively verifiable from trajectory data
5. Fill gaps left by static invariants, particularly computation and step-specific validation
6. Provide working Python code or Natural Language (NL) check for each dynamic assertion that can be executed

## FOCUS AREAS:
Generate invariants that would DETECT the following failure patterns at ANY step in the trajectory:

### **Computation Checks**
- Verify numerical calculations, aggregations, and data accuracy.
- Examples:
  - Financial: "Transaction total should equal sum of line items plus applicable fees"
  - Inventory: "Remaining stock after reservation should be original stock minus reserved quantity"
  - Healthcare: "Medication dosage calculations should be within safe therapeutic ranges"

### **Context-Specific Business Logic**
- Step-specific rules that depend on current trajectory state
- Examples:
  - Retail: "Discount calculations based on current cart contents and user loyalty level"
  - Financial: "Credit limit checks based on current account status and transaction history"
  - Healthcare: "Drug interaction checks based on current prescription list"
  - Workflow: "Approval requirements based on current user role and request amount"

### **Cross-Tool Data Validation**
- Verify data integrity across multiple tool interactions in the same session
- Examples:
  - "Entity identifiers referenced in later steps must match those retrieved in earlier tool outputs"
  - Retail: "Items added to cart must still be available when proceeding to checkout"
  - "If the agent claims an action succeeded, subsequent tool outputs must show evidence consistent with the claim"
  - Financial: "Exchange rates used in calculations must be consistent across related transactions"
  - Healthcare: "Lab results referenced in diagnosis must match the lab results retrieved"
  - System: "File permissions checked must match the permissions set in previous operations"

### **Sequential Dependencies** 
Required ordering between investigation steps and communication steps
- Examples:
  - Incident Management:: "IncidentAgent (fetch incident description) must precede KustoAgent (run diagnostics) for the same incident."
  - General: "User authentication must precede any data access operations"
  - Retail: "User must give explicit confirmation (yes) before any consequential database write actions"

### **Business Rule Constraints**
- Domain-specific operational limits and rules. Incident-management operational limits, safety/compliance constraints, and evidence-grounding rules
- Examples:
  - Incident Management: "Incident updates (or equivalent external communication steps) must be grounded in prior tool outputs (e.g., Kusto results, incident descriptions) within the same trajectory."
  - Incident Management: "IncidentAgent must only return incident descriptions (no extra troubleshooting); KustoAgent must only execute/provide query results (no invented interpretation)."
  - Retail: "Items can only be exchanged within same product category"
  - Healthcare: "Prescriptions require valid medical license verification"
  - Financial: "Transfer amounts cannot exceed daily limits"
  - Legal: "Document modifications require authorized personnel only"

### **Single-Use Restrictions**
- Actions that should occur at most once per incident (or once per approval) to avoid duplicate/unsafe operations
- Examples:
  - Incident Management: "Do not re-run the same Kusto query repeatedly without a stated reason (e.g., changed time window, different cluster, new hypothesis)."
  - Healthcare: "Critical procedure authorization can only be granted once"
  - Financial: "Account closure can only be initiated once per request"
  - System: "Database migration can only be executed once per maintenance window"

Output MUST be valid JSON only (no markdown, no commentary), with EXACT keys and structure defined below.

CRITICAL FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:
1. Output ONLY valid JSON - NO markdown code blocks (no ```json or ```)
2. Use double quotes for all strings (not single quotes)
3. Ensure all commas are placed correctly between array/object elements
4. Ensure all brackets and braces are properly closed
5. Follow the EXACT schema below - do not add or remove fields
6. Validate your JSON before outputting
7. TAXONOMY TARGETS: Use ONLY values from the allowed list.
8. NL_CHECK FIELDS FOR PYTHON_CHECK INVARIANTS: When "check_type": "python_check", the nl_check fields should be empty. Only populate nl_check with actual evaluation logic when "check_type": "nl_check".

================================================================================================
TRAJECTORY FORMAT (IMPORTANT) - THIS WILL BE GIVEN AS AN INPUT PARAMETER
================================================================================================

TRAJECTORY:
The runtime provides a trajectory dict in the following IR schema:

{
  "trajectory_id": "str",
  "instruction": "str",  // The overall task instruction
  "steps": [
    {
      "index": int,  // 1-based step index
      "substeps": [
        {
          "sub_index": int,  // 1-based substep index within the step
          "role": "str",  // The role of the substep
          "content": "str"  // The content of this substep
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

IMPORTANT ACCESS PATTERNS:
- To get instruction: trajectory["instruction"]
- To access step N: trajectory["steps"][N-1] (steps list is 0-indexed, but step.index is 1-based)
- To get substeps of a step: step.get("substeps", [])
- To get content: substep.get("content")
- To get role: substep.get("role")

## Quality Guidelines:
- **Policy-Derived**: Must be supported by the policy document content, include any user confirmation checks before critical actions if specified in policy
- **Practical Impact**: Focus on assertions that prevent real operational problems
- **Domain-Relevant**: Prioritize rules specific to this business domain
- **Reasonable Scope**: Avoid both trivial sanity checks and computation checks better suited for dynamic invariants.

## Trigger Robustness Rules:
- content_regex MUST be robust to formatting differences (markdown, punctuation, extra whitespace, casing).
- NEVER hardcode markdown-sensitive exact strings like:
    "Kusto result:\s*Query successful"
  because real traces often contain:
    "**Kusto result:**\nQuery successful. ..."
- Prefer matching stable substrings that survive formatting changes.
- Prefer SHORT regexes. Avoid overfitting to ":" vs "**:**" vs "." variations.
- Avoid brittle patterns that depend on exact formatting or punctuation.
- Make sure to match the role name perfectly and overapproximate if you are unsure.

Each invariant should be as GENERAL as possible, if many specific invariants can be combined into one invariant function, do so.
For example, an invariant which checks order status validity for various tool calls can be combined into one function.

================================================================================================
DECISION GUIDE: PYTHON_CHECK VS NL_CHECK
================================================================================================
Use python_check when:
- Tool output is structured JSON with extractable fields (e.g., get_order_details, get_user_details)
- Check involves counting, summing, or comparing numeric values
- Check involves verifying exact field matches (IDs, status codes, amounts, dates)
- Check involves parsing and validating data structure or schema
- Check uses simple regex patterns (e.g., matching an order_id format like r"#W\d+" or extracting keys or specific count in the content message)
- Check involves deterministic string containment or exact substring matching

Use nl_check when:
- Check requires understanding paraphrasing or semantic equivalence (e.g., "bigger size" = "larger size")
- Check requires judging whether two different phrasings express the same intent
- Check requires evaluating whether user agent messages align with task instruction semantically
- The content is unstructured natural language without clear fields to extract
- Check would require a long list of synonyms or variations to cover programmatically

A naive python_check approach would try to match exact phrases like:
  - "I want to return"
  - "I'd like to exchange"
  - "cancel my order"
  - "modify my address"
  - "get a refund"
  - "change the items"
But users express the same intent in many ways:
  - "Could you help me send back..." (return)
  - "I need to swap this for..." (exchange)
  - "Please void the order" (cancel)
  - "Update my shipping info" (modify address)
Matching exact phrases is brittle and incomplete. Use nl_check for semantic intent.

================================================================================================
## PYTHON CHECK GUIDELINES
================================================================================================

## Python Code Guidelines:
- Write complete, executable Python functions
- You will be given 2 parameters - (trajectory and current_step_index), where trajectory is the full IR dict with "steps" field
- Access steps via trajectory["steps"][current_step_index] - steps list is 0-indexed
- Each step has "index" (1-based) and "substeps" array
- Each substep has "sub_index", "role", and "content"
- The current_step_index is 0-based. So if the current step being executed has index=7, current_step_index will be 6.
- Include docstrings explaining the assertion
- Look at the tool response key fields very carefully while writing the code.
  1. First, identify which tool(s) you're working with in the current trajectory step
  2. Pay attention to nested dictionaries (use chained .get() calls) and list structures (check length before indexing)
  3. Note the data types (str, float, bool, list, dict) to avoid type errors
  4. Use ONLY the exact field names shown in the tool structure - do NOT invent or assume field names
- Handle edge cases and missing data gracefully - verify field existence and type before operations
- Focus on computation validation and step-specific checks, avoid very trivial sanity checks
- **Exception Handling**: Raise exceptions for safety check violations (KeyError, IndexError, TypeError, AttributeError, ValueError, etc.) instead of returning False. Let these exceptions propagate naturally. Only return boolean (True/False) for actual invariant logic violations
- Return boolean values (True if assertion passes, False if invariant violation detected)
- **Add print statements for debugging**: Start with printing the function name, then print all key variables, extracted JSON fields, and intermediate calculation results to aid in debugging and verification


================================================================================================
## PYTHON_CHECK ANTI-HALLUCINATION RULES
================================================================================================
- A python_check MUST implement ONLY the exact condition(s) described in this invariant's `check_hint`.
- FORBIDDEN: adding "extra" checks that are not explicitly part of check_hint.
  Examples of forbidden extras:
  * checking additional URLs/IDs/regexes beyond the targeted substring(s)
  * inferring "plan rules" not explicitly spelled out in check_hint
  * scanning many steps for unrelated markers "just in case"
  * inventing secondary conditions like "also must not contain X" unless required by check_hint
- Keep python_check SMALL and TARGETED:
  * prefer 1-3 simple extractions + 1 boolean condition
  * avoid long keyword lists and complex regex (if you need that, it is probably a nl_check candidate)

================================================================================================
## NL CHECK GUIDELINES
================================================================================================

For nl_check invariants, MUST include a "focus_steps_instruction" field that tells the judge which specific events to pay attention to.

The instruction should:
1. Be clear and actionable - the judge should know exactly which events to look at
2. Identify 2-4 critical events by their position relative to current_step_index
3. Explain WHY each event is important for the evaluation
4. Use relative positioning (e.g., "immediately prior", "2 steps back", "most recent X tool result")

EXAMPLES OF GOOD FOCUS STEPS INSTRUCTIONS:

For confirmation checks:
"Focus your evaluation on these key events: (1) The immediately prior message - check for explicit confirmation keywords like 'yes', 'confirm', 'proceed', 'ok'. (2) The assistant message two to three steps back - verify that it describes the action of interest (cancel/modify/exchange/return) and mentions the relevant target entity identifier(s) and critical parameters (e.g., record/entity ID, amount, destination, items, scope). (3) The current tool call arguments - verify they match the order_id/incident_id and details mentioned by another agent."

For information invention checks:
"Focus on: (1) The current agent content message being evaluated. (2) The most recent relevant tool results in the window — extract the authoritative facts actually present (identifiers, key fields/attributes, timestamps, computed outputs). (3) Compare specific claims in the agent's message against these tool results."

For temporal/prerequisite checks:
"Focus on: (1) The current tool call event — identify what operation is being attempted and what prerequisites it implies (authentication, entity lookup, permission check, required context fetch, state precondition). (2) Scan backward through all prior events to find the most recent event(s) that satisfy each prerequisite. (3) Most recent state snapshot for the same target entity — locate the latest tool result that reports the entity's current state."

KEY PRINCIPLES:
- Be specific about WHICH events (by relative position or role+name)
- Explain WHAT to look for in each event
- Make it easy for the judge to locate and examine the right evidence
- Reduce cognitive load by narrowing focus to what matters most

Rubric Evaluation Algorithm:
Step 1: For each criterion in the rubric, evaluate whether it can be CLEARLY judged as PASS or FAIL based solely on the provided events.
- Mark as CLEAR_PASS if the criterion is demonstrably satisfied by the evidence
- Mark as CLEAR_FAIL if the criterion is demonstrably violated by the evidence  
- Mark as UNCLEAR if: insufficient events to judge, criterion is ambiguous in this context, or pass/fail cannot be decisively determined

Step 2: Discard ALL criteria marked as UNCLEAR from consideration.

Step 3: Determine final verdict:
- If ANY remaining criterion is CLEAR_FAIL → return verdict 'fail'
- If ALL remaining criteria are CLEAR_PASS (or no criteria remain after discarding UNCLEAR) → return verdict 'pass'

Important: Only fail when you have CLEAR evidence of failure. When in doubt, mark as UNCLEAR and discard.

CRITICAL: If required evidence is missing or ambiguous, mark the criterion as UNCLEAR.

If all criteria are UNCLEAR or CLEAR_PASS after discarding UNCLEAR ones, the final verdict is PASS.
Only mark as CLEAR_FAIL when there is definitive, unambiguous evidence of violation.
Ambiguity or missing evidence leads to PASS, not FAIL.
